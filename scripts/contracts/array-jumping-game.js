/**
 * Array Jumping Game
 *
 * You are given the following array of integers:
 *
 * 3,7,10,5,0,5,6,0,0
 *
 * Each element in the array represents your MAXIMUM jump length at that
 * position. This means that if you are at position i and your maximum jump
 * length is n, you can jump to any position from i to i+n.
 *
 * Assuming you are initially positioned at the start of the array, determine
 * whether you are able to reach the last index.
 *
 * Your answer should be submitted as 1 or 0, representing true and false
 * respectively
 *
 * @param {number[]} input
