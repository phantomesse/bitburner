/**
 * Proper 2-Coloring of a Graph
 *
 * You are given the following data, representing a graph:
 * [8,[[1,5],[2,3],[3,6],[6,7],[2,4],[1,6],[4,6],[2,3],[2,7]]]
 *
 * Note that "graph", as used here, refers to the field of graph theory, and has
 * no relation to statistics or plotting. The first element of the data
 * represents the number of vertices in the graph. Each vertex is a unique
 * number between 0 and 7. The next element of the data represents the edges of
 * the graph. Two vertices u,v in a graph are said to be adjacent if there
 * exists an edge [u,v].
 *
 * Note that an edge [u,v] is the same as an edge [v,u], as order does not
 * matter. You must construct a 2-coloring of the graph, meaning that you have
 * to assign each vertex in the graph a "color", either 0 or 1, such that no two
 * adjacent vertices have the same color.
 *
 * Submit your answer in the form of an array, where element i represents the
 * color of vertex i. If it is impossible to construct a 2-coloring of the given
 * graph, instead submit an empty array.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: [4, [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]]]
 * Output: [0, 0, 1, 1]
 *
 * Input: [3, [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]]]
 * Output: []
 *
 * @param {} input
 * @returns
